# Implementation of React Concepts in Application

This is a brief documentation explaining the implementation of several React concepts in application development.

## 1. Handle Prop Drilling

Prop Drilling is the process of passing data from a parent component to a child component via props, which can then be forwarded to other components in a chain. This can lead to unnecessary complexity, especially if there are many levels of component nesting. To address prop drilling, we can use React Context API or Redux.

## 2. Component Composition

Component Composition is the practice of creating new components by combining multiple smaller components. This enables creating modular and reusable applications, as well as making it easier to understand and manage the code.

## 3. Fetching Data

Fetching Data is the process of retrieving data from a server or other external source using HTTP requests. In React, this is often done using methods like `fetch()` or by using libraries like Axios or Fetch API.

## 4. useEffect

useEffect is a hook used to handle side effects in React components, such as fetching data, subscribing to event listeners, or manipulating the DOM. It is similar to lifecycle methods like componentDidMount, componentDidUpdate, and componentWillUnmount in class components.

## 5. useRef

useRef is a hook used to create a mutable ref that can be used to store a reference to a DOM element or other value within a functional component. It is often used to access and manipulate DOM elements directly in React.

## 6. Custom Hook

Custom Hooks are JavaScript functions that use other hooks and can be used to split related logic into separate and reusable parts. This allows avoiding code repetition and creating cleaner and more understandable logic.
